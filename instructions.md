# Instructions for EPIC Node Server

On first run the installer will download the Epic chain_data bootstrap file (2.5Gb) into the /root/.epic/main folder, unzip to chain_data, then delete the .zip file. This takes approx 10 minutes depending on your internet connection. You can follow the install process by selecting the Service Logs on the Service Dashboard right after first Start. The Service Logs screen will also show the current status when the node server is running.
